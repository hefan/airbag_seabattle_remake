airbag Seabattle
================

Just a quickly done 1:1 Port of a java game from 1996. Useful to learn the basics of the Phaser HTML game framework (https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser).

Created in 1996 together with Paul David Rollmann, head of airbag craftworks.
The glorious & classic arcade game seabattle simulates the everlasting hunt for (defect) air-mattresses that are needed to produce the beloved airbag craftworks' bags (http://www.airbagcraftworks.com)
